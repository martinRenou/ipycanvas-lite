### Deploy a new version of JupyterLite

To deploy a new version of JupyterLite, you can update the version in https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlite-demo/blob/main/requirements.txt.

The `requirements.txt` file can also be used to add extra JupyterLab extensions to the deployed JupyterLite website.

Then commit and push the changes. The site will be deployed on the next push to the `main` branch.

## Development

Create a new environment:

```bash
mamba create -n jupyterlite-demo
conda activate jupyterlite-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then follow the steps documented in the [Configuring](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring.html) section.
